  Technical overview and architecture of CHT Core used to build digital health applications
---

The Core Framework of the Community Health Toolkit (CHT) makes it fast and easy to build digital health tools customised to any health system. The Core Framework is an abstract framework which cannot be experienced without a [CHT application]({{ ref="apps" }}).

The Core Framework enables all the capabilities of CHT applications and ensures that all CHT applications can scale, can be offline-first, and can support multiple languages. Some aspects of CHT Applications are central to the framework and remain the same in all CHT applications - like a shared user-interface that works seemlessly across desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. Other aspects of CHT applications are highly configurable, and can be tailored to uniquely enable a broad array of digital health interventions. 

The Core Framework can be used to support the unique needs of a given health system and the work of community health workers, frontline supervisors, facility-based nurses, health system managers, patients and caregivers. Visit the Commuity Health Toolkit website to request a [self-guided demo](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org/contact) of an example CHT Application.
