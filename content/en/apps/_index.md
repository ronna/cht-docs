  Overview and reference for building CHT applications
---

A CHT application is a digital health tool built on top of the [CHT Core Framework]({{ ref="core" }}). CHT applications can be created to support the unique needs of a health system and the various workers within it. To create a digital health tool using the CHT, either build a CHT application or re-use an existing application.

The CHT Core Framework enables the capabilities of CHT applications through its many configurable components. A CHT application _is_ a set of configurations for Core Framework components. The CHT Core Framework and CHT Applications are interdependent - the core cannot run without an application, and an application cannot run outside the core.

Although the CHT Core Framework provides a lot of flexibile components, other components _are not configurable_. This means that all CHT applications have a set of shared capabilities, attributes, and experiences. For example, all CHT applications share a similar user-interface and share a similar look-and-feel. All CHT applications can be built to scale, can support offline-first experiences, and can support multiple languages.

This section provides an overview of CHT applications, re-usable reference CHT applications, and reference materials for those building CHT applications.
